Hi! I'm **Marcos Rivas**. Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I'll share what I'm learning, building, and thinking about. This space is a mix of hands‑on notes, practical guides, and reflections from real projects.

I'll cover **data science** from a pragmatic angle: how to frame problems, choose the right metrics, and ship models that actually help users. Expect posts on experiment design, feature engineering, evaluation beyond accuracy, and how to communicate results clearly.

I'll also write about **AI/ML**—from classic algorithms to modern LLM workflows. You'll see tutorials, small research summaries, and production tips: prompt design, retrieval, monitoring, and how to keep models maintainable over time.

For **big data**, I’ll share patterns for scaling pipelines and analytics: batch vs streaming, data modeling, and trade‑offs across tools. I like focusing on architecture diagrams and short code snippets you can adapt quickly.

Since I’m a developer at heart, there will be plenty of **programming** content: clean code, testing, performance, and developer experience. I enjoy comparing approaches and explaining the “why” behind design decisions.

Finally, I’ll explore **cloud computing**—infrastructure choices, cost awareness, and deployment workflows. I’ll document what works for me when moving from a notebook to something reliable in the cloud.

If any of this resonates with you, stick around. I hope these posts save you time, spark ideas, and maybe inspire your next project. Let’s build and learn together!
